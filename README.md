# [Knewsly](https://knewsly.netlify.app/)

This website displays latest sports news. The news are retrieved from newsapi.org

## How it works

This project uses the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) for getting sports news. It gets the news data from the API and displays it on the homepage.

## Running Locally

After cloning the repo, go to [News API](https://newsapi.org) to make an account and put your API key in a file called `.local.env`.

Then, run the application in the command line and it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm run dev
```
